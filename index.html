                <input type="radio" name="climate" value="1">
                Temperate: Temperate climates have warm summers and cool winters with year-round rain or snow. Temperate forests are characterized by deciduous trees, which lose their leaves during the winter.
              </li>
              <li>
                <input type="radio" name="climate" value="2">
                Mountain: On mountains, the temperature decreases with altitude (height), and many high peaks are always covered in snow. Mountain climates are usually wetter and windier than lowland regions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <input type="radio" name="climate" value="3">
                Polar: Polar climates are cold and dry, with long, dark winters. In the tundra (a treeless region bordering the Arctic), temperatures rise above freezing for only a few months each year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <input type="radio" name="climate" value="4">
                Tropical: Tropical areas, such as the African savanna, lie between desert areas and tropical rainforests. The climate is hot all year, but with a distinct wet season and dry season.
              </li>
              <li>
                <input type="radio" name="climate" value="5">
                Desert: Earth's deserts are hot and dry year-round, and usually receive less than 10 in (250 mm) of rainfall a year. Deserts are often found in the center of continents, far from the sea.
