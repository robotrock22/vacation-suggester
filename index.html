                Temperate: Temperate climates have warm summers and cool winters with year-round rain or snow. Temperate forests are characterized by deciduous trees, which lose their leaves during the winter.
              </li>
              <li>
                <input type="radio" name="climate">
                Mountain: On mountains, the temperature decreases with altitude (height), and many high peaks are always covered in snow. Mountain climates are usually wetter and windier than lowland regions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <input type="radio" name="climate">
                Polar: Polar climates are cold and dry, with long, dark winters. In the tundra (a treeless region bordering the Arctic), temperatures rise above freezing for only a few months each year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <input type="radio" name="climate">
                Tropical: Tropical areas, such as the African savanna, lie between desert areas and tropical rainforests. The climate is hot all year, but with a distinct wet season and dry season.
              </li>
              <li>
                <input type="radio" name="climate">
                Desert: Earth's deserts are hot and dry year-round, and usually receive less than 10 in (250 mm) of rainfall a year. Deserts are often found in the center of continents, far from the sea.

        <p><strong>Backpacking</strong> is an outdoor recreation where gear is carried in a backpack. This can include food, water, bedding, shelter, clothing, stove, and cooking kit. Weight is necessarily key. Backpacking trips consist of at least one night and can last for weeks or months, sometimes aided by planned resupply points or drops.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-4" id="airbnbdescript">
        <p><strong>Airbnb</strong> is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to list or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in conjunction with every booking. It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries, and the cost of lodging is set by the host. Like all hospitality services, Airbnb is a form of collaborative consumption and sharing.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-4" id="cruisedescript">
        <p><strong>A</strong> cruise ship or cruise liner is a passenger ship used for pleasure voyages, where the voyage itself and the ship's amenities are a part of the experience, as well as the different destinations, i.e., ports of call, along the way. Transportation is not the only purpose of cruising, particularly on cruises that return passengers to their originating port, with the ports of call usually in a specified region of a continent. There are even "cruises to nowhere" or "nowhere voyages" where the ship makes 2â€“3 night round trips without any ports of call.</p>
